# nits

This is a single binary with a collection of scripts and tools that have been used a couple times or are useful from time to time.

Most of these are basically conversion from a collection of Python scripts I've used overtime for quick things, but converting to Go makes them easily usable across systems without worrying about dependencies for the most part.

A more general purpose and more robust tool is [anbu](https://github.com/tanq16/anbu). As and when I find a script or quick tool implemented here more useful and more frequently used, I will promote them to go into `anbu`.
